    "#   Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, \n",

    "#   and behavior. Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being that is described by \n",
    "#   properties like name and address, down to small computer programs, such as widgets. This opposes the historical \n",
